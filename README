No much to add different from last README, basically the assignment were pretty similar so I just had to tweak for new variables to be read from the test file. Fot the types I created a bitfield so it eas easier to identify the type of object. I will add a drief description of my last assignment READMe just in case the T.A that is gradding the assignment didn't grade my last. This way it would have  abetter understanding of what I did. 
For this assigment I used the base knowledge we gained on C++ from lectures, plus some websites that gave me the template to start using ifstream. For parsing I just used a combination of getline() -> with delimeters, and the substr() function to parse some fields (like the diece variables). This assigment was very helpfull to get started with C++. It gave me experince on C++, integration of C with C++, how prepare the C files for use with C++. I want to add that for time constrains I didn't create a dice object to save the dice variables (base,dice,sides), BUT I did parse them and store them in Ints, also I sotre the color and abil of the npc in int variables that is values is determine by a bit field (this is what was required for the assigment).
