///ASSIGMENT 1///
#01/25/2015 (1.01 Dungeon Generation)
-Started the dungeon 
-Created the dungeon representation in a 2-D array [160][96]
-represented the rooms with a struct
-Created the function to initialize the dimensions of a room


#01/26/2015
-implemented create_rooms(), all rooms are place correctly on the map with all rules met
-Corridors implement in vertical and horizontal direction, Used the centro point of two 
consecutive place rooms to create them.
*corridors are experience a incomplete block at the end of output
*Having problems to compile code when tried to create header file

#01/27/2015
-Fixed compilation problem, I was missing a ";" on the header file
-Fixed corridors
///ASIGMENT 1 DONE ///

//ASSIGMENT 2 ///
#01/30/2015
-Started assignment
-Used as template code of FILE I/O that we wrote in class.
-Declare Dungeon array that would represent the dungeon in the binary file
-Started to write to dungeon binary file. Successfully wrote the header "RLG229"

#02/01/2015
-Successfully recorded the map cells in the binary file
-Working in getting the file size and the room coordinates (To be completed)
-It seems all the fields are saved correctly on the file

#02/02/2015
-got working load and save
-work pretty nice
-Clean code, gonna review with professor details and submit
//ASSIGMENT 2 DONE ///

//ASIGMENT 3 //

02/6/2015
- started planning heap min data struct
- Researche wikipedia article to develo dijktra algorithm for finding shortest path

02/10/2015
- Started implementation of heap min, still trying to figure out how sort elements by key
- Created a typedef struct "node_path" that wil hold cost, position, index on heap and previous
node, this will provide data to dijktra algorithm .

02/12/2015
- Almost finished heap_min, still figuring out how implement correctly the decrease_key function
- logic for dijktra almost complete

02/13/2015
- Finally got done with the min heap
- Having a lot of seg faults when trying to test algorithm, will start testing by parts

02/16/2015
- Seg fault are gone, but the map only show one 'P' ('P' is my debug terrain to show the shortest path)
- Logi seem to be fine, sadly it must be a small bug what I have

02/17/2015
-Finally got it working 99% of the time, very few time it outputs a random 'P' not following the path
- I have spent +50 hours in this assignment, so I hope this small bug doesn't affect severe my grade. 

//ASSIGMNET 3 DONE


//ASSIGMENT 4 START///

02/19/2015
- started planning assigment
- Implemented Character_t struct that represent a character on the map

02/20/2015
- Created a modified dijktra algorithm called dijktra_game, to keep turn of character
- Having some problems moving the characters 

02/21/2015
- Telepathic & Smart Monster moving correctly, also PC moving left-and right only 
- Starting implementing non-smart and only telepathic monstes

02/23/2015
- All monsters type implemented correctly, 
- Starting implementing ending of game

02/24/2015
- All implemented correctly, Assignment done.

//Assignment 4 done 

//Assignment 5 
03/01/2015
- starting planning strategy for assignment 
- include initialization ncurses function from lectures

02/01/2015 
- finished character movement 
- finished displaying only 80*24 display 

03/01/2015
- finished Look-mode
- not had time to do stairs part
//Assignment 5 done

//Assignment 6///

03/19/2015
-started assignment
--thinking approach to write info to file
- noticed that all the info from the PC can be saved
using the dungeon structure
-almost finished the writing portion of the assigment

03/20/2015
- had to configure the dugeon writing function, due to the 
stairs
- finished PC data saving, starting NPC storage.
- all the info about the NPC can be getted from the dungeon
structure
- finished NPC portion, starting modifiying reading portion
- reading portion done, starting auto-loading and deletion of 
game file when finished.
- game done. 

//Assigment 6 done

//Assigment 7///

03/30/2015
- created a parser.cpp and parser.h files for the assigment
- started creating a strign isntance to parse the text file 
using the getline() method
- use getenv() function to get to the monster file on the /.rlg229 folder
- Having some problems parsing number from strings

- finalyly got to parse the diece variables from speed,ham, hp, assigment done

03/31/2015

- added variables ints to store the color and abil of the monsters

//Assigment 7 done (In one day :) )

//Start Assignment 8////

04/07/2014 

-start assignmet base on last week assignmet
- replaced/added variable names to accomodate the parser for new text file
- create bit field for the new TYPES
- tested the assignmen (IT WORKS :) 

/////Done assignment 8 /////////////
